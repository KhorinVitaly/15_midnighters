# Night Owls Detector

This script for Devman's student. If you can look in terminal who of your colleagues work at night, you can do it with
this script.


#How to Install

Python 3 should be already installed. Then use pip (or pip3 if there is a conflict with old Python 2 setup) to install
dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt # alternatively try pip3
```

#Quickstart

Just launch seek_dev_nighters.py in terminal 

```
Devman has midnighters:

Remember, it is recommended to use virtualenv/venv for better isolation.
